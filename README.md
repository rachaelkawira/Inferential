# Inferential Analysis of Chick Feed Data

## Overview
This repository contains an inferential analysis of the chick feed data using R. The analysis aims to explore the impact of different types of feed on the growth rates of chicks and to draw conclusions based on statistical inference.

## Dataset
The chick feed dataset is a built-in dataset in R that includes information about various types of feed given to chicks and their corresponding weight gain over time. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **feed**: Type of feed provided to the chicks (e.g., diet A, diet B).
- **weight**: Weight gain of chicks (in grams).
- **age**: Age of the chicks (in days).

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:
- To compare the weight gain of chicks on different feed diets.
- To perform hypothesis testing to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the weight gains of chicks on different diets.
- To provide visualizations that effectively communicate the results of the analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and prepared for analysis, including any necessary cleaning and transformation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the data through summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distributions and relationships.
3. **Inferential Statistics**: 
   - Conduct hypothesis tests (e.g., ANOVA) to compare weight gains across different diets.
   - Calculate confidence intervals for the mean weight gain for each diet.
4. **Visualizations**: Generate plots (e.g., boxplots, bar charts) to illustrate findings.

## Results
The analysis will provide insights into:
- The effectiveness of different feeds on chick growth.
- Statistical significance of differences observed in weight gain.

## Installation
To run the analysis, ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed. You can install the required packages using the following commands:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "lme4", "tidyverse"))
